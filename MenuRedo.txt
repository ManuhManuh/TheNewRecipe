Single scene with all flat UI in it - this is for start UI only, so that Chapter01 can load
*instantiate canvas1 in the scene (has play instead of resume)
Put player at 0,0,0 in the UI scene
Move Chapter01 scene so that player at 0,0,0 is in the right position
*This way if the intro is skipped the player is already in the correct position
=> never mind - code it properly so the player always enters any scene at the player start position


When menu button pushed in game, move player to Menu position (away from lighting)
*do not change scenes
*canvas2 instantiated
*do not include ability to play intro
*include:
	*resume
	*quit
	*instructions
	*settings

Go back to flat UI scene at the end, show credits panel



Drawers:
Let go when moved too far
