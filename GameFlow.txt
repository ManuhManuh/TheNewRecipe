Main Game:

		*middle one has plus drink rings that indicate solution to wine puzzle
		*right one has tap
	*Try drawers in wine cabinet: 
		*left one has a tap, but handle is hidden until wine puzzle is solved
		*middle one has note: "Don't forget to put the wine away"
		*right one has a knife
			*Use knife to slice open bag beside the cabinet: find key to open left desk drawer
			*Use key to open drawer in desk: get hammer
	*Pick up item (one of several - they don't go into inventory) from shelves and smash vases: find a tap
